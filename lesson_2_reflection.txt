Q.1 What happens when you initialise you repository?
Ans:-When we make a simple directory a git repository by making use of 
the command "git init", it creates a hidden .git directory inside our 
pwd so as to store all the commits made by us. But initially it has no
commits. So the 1st thing to do after initialising a repository is to
make a commit.

Q.2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans:-The staging area offers us the facility of commiting selective files
instead of all the files in a commit. It is helpful since it is advised
to make a commit to each logical change and one logical change may alter
a few files not all, so we need to only commit only those altered files.
This concept of staging area is good as it gives the user more power and
customisation.
